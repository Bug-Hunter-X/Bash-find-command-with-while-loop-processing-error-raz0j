This repository demonstrates a common but subtle error in bash scripting when using the find command with a while loop to process files. The bug lies in the incorrect expansion of the file variable within the loop, leading to unexpected behavior. The solution provides the correct way to handle file processing to achieve desired results. The files `bug.sh` and `bugSolution.sh` contain the buggy and corrected code respectively.
